# Check42

My 2-day-implementation of the Check24 Holiday Challenge for the GenDev Scholarship. It has minimal elements needed to get the entire tech stack working:

- Flutter front-end: Simple phone app with search function, REST API request and fetch from the back-end.
- Flask API: Handles REST API requests and responses.
- Python: Callbacks from the Flask layer to parse requests, create SQL queries, and encode the result as JSON.
- Sqlite: Simple SQL database that saves the actual offers and hotels.
